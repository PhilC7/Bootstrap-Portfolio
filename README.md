# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

For this portfolio I have re-created and slightly redesigned my original portfolio. This time I have used the Bootstrap CSS Framework for the layout.

Making sure I reached the following criteria:

- A navigation bar.

  - Contain relevant links which navigate to their matching sections.

- A hero section.

  - Featuring a picture, my name and any other information.

- A work section

  - A section displaying my work in grid.
  - Use bootstrap cards for each project.
  - A description giving a brief overview of the work.

- A skills section

  - List out the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.

- An about / contact section.

- A footer section.
  - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
  - Any buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
